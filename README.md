# Youtube-Views-Time-Series

In this case study, we are tasked with forecasting the number of views for the next 10 hours of a fictional YouTube video using time series analysis. 
The first step involves checking whether the data is stationary and transforming it if it is not. The data is then modeled using ARIMA models and 
the best model is selected for the forecast. Finally, the transformed data is back-transformed to obtain the forecast for the original series, 
and model diagnostics are performed to further investigate the chosen model.
